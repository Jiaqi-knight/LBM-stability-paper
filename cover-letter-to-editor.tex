Dear Prof. Pinho:

Thank you very much for your assistance with our article titled "Numerical Investigation of the Accuracy, Stability, and Efficiency of Lattice Boltzmann Methods in Simulating Non-Newtonian Flow" by Matthew Grasinger, Scott Overacker, and John C. Brigham for publication in the Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics. We are submitting to you the revised manuscript in which we have addressed the suggestions by the reviewers. In addition to the revised manuscript, we have included a document of our responses to the reviewers. Please let us know if any further modification or information is required.

All correspond should be addressed to:
