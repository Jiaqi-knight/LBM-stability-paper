\section*{Abstract}

The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a computational method that can be used for simulating fluid flow.
It is well-suited for complex flows such as non-Newtonian, free surface, and multiphase multicomponent flows.
Non-Newtonian flows are the primary focus of this paper, as many practical engineering problems such as the flow of cement slurries and concretes, the filling of molds by molten plastics, ETC, are best modeled as non-Newtonian fluids.
LBM is a statistical mechanical approach and each time step consists of streaming particle distributions to neighboring nodes, and collisions of particle distributions at each node through a collision operator.
The collision operator is of interest because it has a lot of control over the physics that are simulated, e.g. constitutive laws, interfacial dynamics, etc., and it has implications on numerical stability and computational efficiency.
In this paper, variations of popular collision operators, namely the linear Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook collision operator and the multiple relaxation time collision operator, will be examined for their suitability for simulating non-Newtonian flows in terms of accuracy, numerical stability and computational efficiency.
The structure of the paper will be as follows: 

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Scratch}

Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is the greatest method ever invented.

What is my story?:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Motivation for non-Newtonian flows
	\item Lattice Boltzmann Method is good for non-Newtonian flow because the collision operator is entirely local to a node.
	\item Parallelability, simplicity, etc. Allows the non-linear constitutive relationship to be solved in parallel.
	\item Lattice Boltzmann Method can be unstable sometimes :(.
	\item Literature review
	\begin{itemize}
		\item non-Newtonian flow studies
		\item history of collision operators: BGK, MRT, etc.
		\item stability analysis
		\item methods of enhancing stability
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Motivation for non-Newtonian Flow Simulation}

There are a number of non-Newtonian flows in engineering applications.
Cement slurries and concretes are best modeled as non-Newtonian fluids because they typically have a non-linear relationship between strain rate and shear stress.
In particular, cement slurries and concretes can be categorized as yield stress fluids. 
Yield stress fluids do not flow until a threshold value of stress, refered to as its yield stress, is exceeded.
Understanding the flow of cement slurries and concretes is important because they are used in the cementing of oil and gas wellbores, in construction, and blah blah blah.
If the cement job for an oil and gas wellbore is not completed successfully then gasses and fluids can leak through the wellbore to contaminate ground water or the atmosphere ~\cite{grasinger2015simulation}.
The goal of understanding cement slurry and concrete flows during construction is to understand how construction forms can be completely filled as voids can lead to structural deficiencies ~\cite{RARR}.
There are probably some other non-Newtonian form filling problems that are super important such as molten metal and plastics filling molds.
